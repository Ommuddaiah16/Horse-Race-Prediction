## 1. Introduction

This project aims to predict horse racing outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset spans from 1990 to 2020 and includes comprehensive information on horse races and individual horses. Given the inherent unpredictability of horse racing, our goal is to leverage advanced machine learning models and feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy.

## 2. Dataset Description

The dataset comprises two primary types of files: races and horses, available annually from 1990 to 2020. Additionally, the `forward.csv` file provides crucial pre-race information such as average odds from Oddschecker.com, and current RPR and TR values.
